Installing SQLite for Windows 7

NOTE: All tools are also available under R:\Tools\to_install\Sqlite

    1. Download sqlite-tools-win32-x86-[VERSION_NUMBER].zip from
            https://www.sqlite.org/download.html
    2. extract the content of the zip file to a folder of your choice
    3. one can verify the installation by navigating to the installation folder in a command line window
        and calling the command "sqlite3". If everything went well SQLite should start and connect to a
        temporary in-memory database


Creating a new SQLite Database
    -  A new permanent Database can be created by calling the command "sqlite3 path\to\database" which
        starts the SQLite Shell connected to the new database. Next call ".databases" this should list
        the created database. If all went well the database file should now be visible in the file system


Using SQLite from the SpRring Tool Suite


    1. Next we need to download a jdbc driver to use SQLite from Java. The Xerial sqlite jdbc from
            https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/downloads
        works well for me. I used version 3.23.1.
    2. In Spring Tool Suite access the "Database Development" view. In the "Data Source Explorer" a
        folder called "Database Connections" should be visible.
    3. Choosing "New..." in its context menu, leads us to a "New Connection Profile" dialogue.
        Here we choose to create a SQLite Connection.
    4. After clicking Next we need to specify a Driver and Connection Details. For Driver we choose
        a "New Driver Definition". A new Dialogue opens. As a driver template we choose
        SQLite JDBC Driver. In the tab "JAR List" a driver file "sqlitejdbc-v051.jar" is already selected.
        We first add the "sqlite-jdbc-[VERSION_NUMBER].jar", that we downloaded before. Afterwards we need
        to remove the driver file that was selected before. Exit the dialogue via "OK"
    5. Now we only need to chose the location and name of the previously created database. Note that the
        database should already exist as a file. See above on how create a database in SQLite. After clicking
        "Finish" the new connection is visible immediately in the Data Source Explorer.
    6. Now we can create new SQL files in the Spring Tool Suite and execute them to create or modify Tables
        the database or access it from Java
